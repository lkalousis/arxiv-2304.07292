{\bf Answers to the referee}
\\[1ex]

I would like to thank the referee for all his comments. 
I have tried to address them along the lines that now follow:
\\[1ex]

C: \emph{ I would suggest removing the type of PMT from the title, making it more generic. } 
	
A: I have changed the title to ``Calibration of photomultiplier tubes with gaussian single photoelectron response'' 
to accommodate the referee's comment.
Several parts of the text (especially in the Introduction) have changed, but only lightly, to reflect this modification. 
\\[1ex]

C: \emph{The tests with PMT could still be mentioned in the abstract} 

A: I have added a mention in the abstract.
\\[1ex]

C: \emph{ It would be more evident if the author would provide a comparison of the new method with the original one and demonstrate the improvement of the precision. }
	
A: A section dedicated to this study has been added (section 3.3). 
One can see that inside the $\mu$ 0.5 - 0.2 range both methods return the same gain. 
The advantages of the DFT lies in the following (inside $\mu$ 0.5 - 0.2):
\begin{itemize}
\item DFT gives a better $\chi^2$/NDOF and, 
\item DFT runs much faster. 
It is (almost) 200 times faster than the numerical integration method. 
\end{itemize}
